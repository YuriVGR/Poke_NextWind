# Pokedex made beautiful

This is a pokedex made with Next.js and TailwindCSS. It uses the PokeAPI to fetch data about pokemons.

## The idea

I aim to create a versatile project that can be used to showcase the power of TailwindCSS. It will be will be simple, fast, responsive, beautiful and easy to understand. (At least I hope so)

## Using the project

I will publish the project on Vercel and will provide the source code on Github. 

You can use the project as a template to create your own pokedex if you want.

## Contributing

As I'm still learning, I'm open to any suggestions, comments and recommendations.
